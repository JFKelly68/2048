# Clone 2048 Game
Based on a coding challenge that asked to implement the `swipeLeft` functionality, this grew a little out of hand but was a lot of fun

### ToDo
  - break out into separate files and server
  - add logic for win/lose state
  - set top limit for merging of numbers
  - deploy/host
  - improve basic styling
  - add animations
    - separate display "board" from display "points" (points should overlay the board, not *be* the board)
  - custom grid size?
