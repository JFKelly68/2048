# Clone 2048 Game
Based on a coding challenge that asked to implement the `swipeLeft` functionality, this grew a little out of hand but was a lot of fun

### ToDos
  - See Github issues/project board

## Development
To run the project in development, follow these steps
- Create an `.env` file copied from the `env_sample` and fill in the variables as you see fit
- run `npm i`
- run `npm start`
- open a browser window pointing to the env vars as you dictated OR `http://localhost:8000` (if you didn't provide any)

Voil√†!
